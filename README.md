# HW11_UFOs

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project was create a website to display information that has been gathered concerning UFO sightings.  A key component of the website for UFO enthusiasts to be able to filter the information in the data to narrow the search to dates, locations, and shapes of the sightings that have been logged.

## Results
When the page is first loaded a headline with a screen wide image is visible,

It is difficult to find the sightings that are most interesting in this format.  That is why the filters have been created.

In order for the users of this website to be able to narrow down the search results, multiple filters can be activate at the same time.

This allows for quicker research into the data being shared.

## Summary
* ### Drawback of New Design
  * One drawback about the design is that if the date is typed mm/dd/yy instead of mm/dd/yyyy no results will be returned.

* ### Recommendations For Further Development
  * In order to prevent a failure due to incorrect date maybe a pop up calendar could be used to limit the date entry to a format that could handled by the javascript program.

  * Another feature that could be useful would be to have the ability to sort the data in the table.  That way it would be easier to scan by states that a Ufologist may be interested in.

  * The ability to export findings would be another example of a useful feature for possible further development.

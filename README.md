## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project was create a website to display information that has been gathered concerning UFO sightings.  A key component of the website for UFO enthusiasts to be able to filter the information in the data to narrow the search to dates, locations, and shapes of the sightings that have been logged.

## Results
When the page is first loaded a headline with a screen wide image is visible, below that is a paragraph about UFO enthusiasts with a separate title and subtitle introducing the paragraph, then all of the sightings are displayed With a section for filters beside it.  It is difficult to find the sightings that are most interesting in this format.  That is why the filters have been created.
